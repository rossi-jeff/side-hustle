        <b>PHP</b> is an open source general purpose scripting language originally developed by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. It initially stood for <i>personal home page</i>, but was later changed to the recursive <i>PHP hypertext preprocessor</i>. The term preprocessor means that the PHP code is usually processed by the web server and the result of that execution is sent to the browser.
