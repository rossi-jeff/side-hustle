      <p>
        <b>Ruby on Rails</b> is a server side MVC (model / view / controller) framework written in <b>Ruby</b> and released in 2005. One main benefit of MVC is the separation on concerns, meaning the database access, business logic, and display are done separately. Two best practices that are core to <b>Rails</b> are convention of configuration (CoC), and don't repeat yourself (dry). I find the <b>Ruby</b> programming language to be elegant and concise.

      <p>
        <b>Rails</b> is a rapid development framework and through the use of a command line interface (cli) new features can be prototyped quite quickly. In some cases Rails can be used as a back-end for a Node.js application and render data as <b>JSON</b>.

      <p>
        <b>Ruby</b> also has a package respository to simplify common tasks, the packages within are referred to as <b>gems</b>.
