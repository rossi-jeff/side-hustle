        Node.js is an open sourced event driven javascript runtime library designed to run javascript code outside of a web browser, for example on a web server. It is based on the V8 javascript engine that is the core of the chrome web browser. Node was initially written by Ryan Dahl in 2009

      <p>
        A key feature of Node.js is that there is a package repository where developers can include packages in their projects in order to include key features without needing to reinvent the wheel. These packages range in size and complexity and on the larger end include the frameworks <b>Angular</b>, <b>React</b>, and <b>Vue</b>.

        This website is a small <b>Vue</b> project, though I have worked with all three frameworks.
